If you fail to receive this confirmation, please check your bulk email box or contact the editorial assistant.</p>

                                    <p class="text-justify"><strong>Basic Review:</strong> The editor or editorial assistant determines whether the manuscript fits the journal's focus and scope. Next, a check for the similarity rate is done using Cross-check, powered by authenticating. Any manuscripts out of the journal's scope or containing plagiarism, including self-plagiarism, are rejected. Manuscripts out of the journal's scope are rejected. Articles published fully or partly in other publications/websites are not reviewed or accepted.</p>

The submitted manuscript will be reviewed by at least three experts: one editorial staff member as well as one to three external reviewers. The review process may take <strong>two to 3 months</strong>.</p>

The reviewers grade a submitted manuscript on a scale of 1 to 5. To be accepted for publication, the manuscript must obtain an average score of not less than 2.5. If differences of opinion occur between reviewers, the editor or editorial assistant will weigh all comments and arrive at a balanced decision based on all comments, or a second round of peer review may be initiated.</p>

Based on a minor or major revision, the author will be given a limited time to send a feedback report according to the reviewer's comments and some comments of the editorial board. Then the editorial board will work on it to make the final decision.</p>
